# MobileComputingPraktikum

Hi Guys! Thanks for playing the new GeoQuiz "GeoGeo!"! 
We are a group of students at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz/Germany.

  Due to a traineeship of the "Mobile Computing"-lecture we were commissioned to develop an application that is on the one hand fun to play and on the other hand capable of giving students some information about their environment. Therefore we decided to develop our GeoGeo! so that you and your friends can explore and enjoy the world by playing our quiz.
  
  **Have Fun!**
